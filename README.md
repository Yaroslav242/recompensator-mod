# recompensator-mod
Adds the recompensator, an electrically-powered liquid capsule launcher!
# How to use
The weapon is crafted with titanium, silicon, plastanium and metaglass

First add a liquid for it to launch, then power it using electricity.

Consumes two water extractors, and as much power as one. The guns do not extinguish fires automatically when supplied with water or cryo.

Water has more splash area and has twice the consumption rate, slag does more splash damage, cryo slows units down and oil can be set on fire.
